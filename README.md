This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I first started this project as a playground for the more recent Next.js features, pnpm, tailwind.

## Global deps

I'm using:

#### NODE v20.10.0

#### PNPM v8.12.1

## Project deps

First, install workspace dependencies:

```sh
npm i
# or
pnpm i
```

## To run the app locally

Then, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
